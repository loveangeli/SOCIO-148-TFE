        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Reinforce the importance of understanding mental health from both a medical and cultural perspective.</p>
<p>• Both medical and cultural means that we do not limit mental health to only the illness, but rather the person as a whole. Active calls to change perspective on the humanization of mental health will affect policy making in issues such as underinvestment, lack of mental health professionals and underdeveloped community mental health services (Lally et al., 2019).
</p>
<p>• Filipinos' reluctance to seek psychological help is influenced by cultural beliefs and misconceptions about mental illness. Traditional explanations attribute mental health issues to supernatural causes, such as God’s will or witchcraft, leading many to prefer folk healers over mental health professionals. Misconceptions, such as viewing mental illness as a temporary issue or a personal failing, further discourage help-seeking. 
</p>
<p>• Cultural factors like spirituality, fear of losing face, and the availability of social support act as both barriers and facilitators to seeking professional psychological help (Martinez et al., 2020) </p>
<p>• This supposes that more mental health programs and advocacies should not dismiss the significance of the various cultural belief systems that Filipinos have in regards to mental health. Societal response should also cover socio-cultural bases along with medical ones.
